USER MANUAL FOR GRADING SYSTEM
BY HSIAO-TUNG DONG and EVA AREVALO

1.Overview: 

This Grading System is designed to store and display the grades for a student, as well as his/her rank respective to the other alumni in the dataset, and his/her final grade. The final grade is calculated by applying a weighted average on the student's grades. 


2.Parameters:

The system includes the names of the students and their respective IDs and grades already. Each student has 5 grades for different exams/labs. It's not possible to add new students or change their grades. 
The weights for the system to calculate the final grades and student ranks can however be adjusted for the entire system. 

3.System Description:

Upon loading the system a Welcome message is displayed and the user is prompted for a ID to query the database for the student's info or a 'Q' letter to quit the system (Fig1).

Once an Id is inputted, the system displays a list of possible commands to choose from, which are to be accessed by typing the letters 'G', 'R', 'A' 'W' and 'E' (Fig2).

*****Possible Fig 2******

The commands are as below:
  a. G(Grade): This command allows the system to display the 5 grades in the system for the user in question(Fig3).

  *****Possible Fig 3******

  b. R(Rank): This command allows the system to display the rank of the student with respect to all the other students in the system. The higher the number, the lower the number, the better the performance of this student with respect to his/her peers (Fig4).

  c. A(Average): This command uses te weight array in the system to calculate a weighted average of the grades of the student in question (Fig5).

  *****Possible Fig 5******

  d. W(Weight): This command allows the system to display the current weights for each of the 5 grades stored in the system. The weights are displayed using percentages (Fig 6a). The system then prompts the user to enter a new weight percentage for each one of the 5 instances of the grades for that user (Fig 6b). The system asks the user to input the weights once again for each of the grades for the sake of confirmation (Fig 6c). Finally, the system requires the user to either confirm or drop the changes on the wieghts by inputting either a 'Y' letter for 'YES' or a 'N' letter for 'NO'(Fig6d).


  *****Possible Fig 6a,b,c,d******

  e. E(Exit): This commands allows the system to exit the info of the most recently inputted ID and return to the shell to continue querying the database.


4.Error Handling:

The system is able to recover from the following errors:

  a. Inputed ID doesn't exist in the system's database.

  b. The command inputed after entering a student ID is not valid.
